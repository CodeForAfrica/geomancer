  <h1>How to contribute data sources to Geomancer</h1>
  <p>
      Do you have a data source you'd like to add to <strong>Geomancer</strong>?
      We built this as in an open, extensible platform, so anyone can contribute.
      If you know how to program in Python, you add your own data source using the
      instructions below. Otherwise, post your request to our
      <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/geomancer" target="_blank">

  <h3>Step 1: Fork the Geomancer repo</h3>

  <h3>Step 2: Create a new <code>BaseMancer</code> class</h3>
      <p>
          Geomancer implements a base class that establishes a pattern for setting up a new data source.
          Simply inherit from that class and override a few properties and methods like so:
      </p>
      <pre>
  from geomancer.mancers.base import BaseMancer

  class MyGreatMancer(BaseMancer):

      name = 'The best mancer ever'
      machine_name = 'best_mancer'
      base_url = 'http://lotsadata.gov/api'
      info_url = 'http://lotsadata.gov'
      description = 'This is probably the best mancer ever written'

      def column_info(self):
          return 'woo'

      def search(self, geo_ids=None, columns=None):
          return 'woo'

      def geo_lookup(self, search_term, geo_type=None):
          return 'woo'
      </pre>
      <p>
          Detailed information about how the responses from these
          methods should be structured as well as two example mancers
          can be found in the
          <a href="https://github.com/associatedpress/geomancer/tree/master/geomancer/mancers" target="_blank">
              Github repository
          </a>.
      </p>
  <h3>Step 2b: Add a <code>GeoType</code>. (Optional)</h3>
      <p>
          Does your mancer offer data that relates to geographic areas that are not
          currently offered by Geomancer? This is also built in an extensible way. Each
          <code>GeoType</code> is implemented as a subclass that expects
          a few static properties to be overridden:
      </p>
      <pre>
  from geomancer.mancers.geotype import GeoType

  class RandomGeography(GeoType):
      human_name = 'Randomly selected geographies'
      machine_name = 'random_geo'
      formatting_notes = 'Rows with this geography should contain a random \
          selection of upper and lowercase ASCII characters'
      formatting_example = 'jksalassJJnsjkJSAdjdfhsjAWHJSL'

      </pre>
      <p>
          More details on how to implement a new <code>GeoType</code> can be found
          <a href="https://github.com/associatedpress/geomancer/blob/master/geomancer/mancers/geotype.py" target="_blank">
              here
          </a>.
      </p>
  <h3>Step 3: Register your mancer in the application cofiguration.</h3>
      <p>
          The basic configuration options for Geomancer exist in <code>app_config.py</code>.
          Add the import path to the module where you wrote your mancer and you should start seeing
          it as an option when you run the app.
      </p>
  <h3>Step 4: Submit a pull request! </h3>
      <p>
